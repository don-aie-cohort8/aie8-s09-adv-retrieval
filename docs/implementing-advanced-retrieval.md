# Implementing Advanced Retrieval

## the importance of retrieval in RAG systems

1. Better Retrieval = Better Context = Better Answers
    - “LLMs generate responses based on the context they’re given. If the retrieval process is weak, the model has bad or incomplete information, leading to poor answers.”
    - “By improving retrieval, we improve the quality and accuracy of generated responses.”
2. Ensuring Data is Represented & Retrieved Properly
    - “It’s not just about retrieving any data—it’s about retrieving the right data.”
    - “Maximizing retrieval effectiveness ensures our model is working with the most useful information.”

## Implement & Compare Different Retrievers

### RAG Retriever Comparison

1. Naive Retrieval

- ✅ Easiest to implement

- ❌ Poor relevance; potential for including unrelated chunks

2. BM25 (Best-Matching 25)

- ✅ Fast, no embeddings required

- ❌ Weak with semantically similar phrasing

3. Multi-Query Retrieval

- ✅ Improves coverage via prompt variations

- ❌ Slower and more expensive (multiple queries)

4. Parent-Document Retrieval

- ✅ Preserves accuracy while retrieving larger chunks

- ❌ Can pull in too much irrelevant info

5. Contextual Compression (Rerank)

- ✅ Improves relevance with post-filtering

- ❌ Adds latency and extra compute cost (minor)

6. Ensemble Retrieval

- ✅ Combines strengths of multiple methods

- ❌ Complex to tune and harder to debug

7. Semantic Chunking

- ✅ Smarter chunk boundaries = better context

- ❌ Requires preprocessing; tool support varies

### Encourage learners to:

- Run different retrieval methods in their notebooks.
- Observe how different retrievers return different results.
- Discuss when one method might be preferable over another.

## Takeaways

- “Better retrieval = better context = better model responses.”
- “Each retrieval method has trade-offs—choosing the right one depends on the use case.”
